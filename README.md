# AI_extractor_medical_info
DataCamp platform project, with the goal of  leveraging the OpenAI API to automatically extract medical information from these transcripts and automating the matching with the appropriate ICD-10 codes

Medical professionals often summarize patient encounters in transcripts written in natural language, which include details about symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments. These transcripts can be used for other medical documentation, such as for insurance purposes, but as they are densely packed with medical information, extracting the key data accurately can be challenging. The dataset contains anonymized medical transcriptions categorized by specialty.
